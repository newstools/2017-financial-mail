Acclaimed winelands restaurant Terroir has just released its famous winter menu, and every indication is that this will be the hottest table in Stellenbosch when the cold sets in. In previous years, chef Michael Broughton put out a stand-alone winter menu separate from the à la carte offering, but this year the restaurant is offering a taste of the full à la carte menu, together with the winter menu, at pocket-friendly prices. Topping the menu is a flame-grilled, dry-aged sirloin served atop a celeriac velouté, brisket croustillants and baby vegetables. For vegetarian diners there is Broughton’s potato gnocchi, pan-fried and served atop a salsa verde with baby vegetables and raw mushrooms, and a generous shaving of black truffle. There is also a sesame-crusted tuna loin served with white bean and miso purée. Regulars will be happy to hear that Terroir’s legendary prawn risotto with Américaine sauce remains on the selection of starters. And, for the first time, there is a multicourse tasting menu that allows diners to select any four dishes from the à la carte offering with slightly smaller portions. The four-course menu is priced at R395 per person. The two-course menu (starter/main or main/dessert) is R295 per person and includes a glass of Kleine Zalze Vineyard Selection wine. The menu is available until the end of September.
