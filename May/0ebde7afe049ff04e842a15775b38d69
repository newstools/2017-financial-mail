This year, SA will be represented at the Venice Biennale by artists Mohau Modisakeng and Candice Breitz. Of course, not many South Africans will get to travel to that exhibition, which is why Modisakeng’s exhibition at Johannesburg’s Standard Bank Gallery will have particular resonance. Modisakeng, who trained as a sculptor, has become best known for his photographic series and video installations. In Lefa La Ntate, he experiments with the camera, placing himself in his pictures. The works in the exhibition also touch on SA’s colonial and apartheid past. The exhibition will run at the gallery from June 2 to July 8.
