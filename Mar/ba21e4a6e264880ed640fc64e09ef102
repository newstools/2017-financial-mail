The tussle for control of Barclays Africa Group (BGA) has cooled down, with the pan-African banker announcing its UK parent, Barclays, had agreed to an empowerment deal as part of its separation agreement.Parties such as Dubai-based private equity firm Abraaj, which manages about US$10bn in assets, and a consortium led by former Barclays boss Bob Diamond have been quiet since BGA said it had agreed on the terms of separation with its parent &mdash; a crucial step for Barclays to get regulatory approval to sell its interest below the 50% level.Barclays, which holds 50.1% of BGA, announced the key terms of the R12.8bn separation agreement two weeks ago. This includes an empowerment deal with as yet unnamed parties, to which Barclays will contribute R2.1bn.BGA is yet to announce how many shares will be made available to the black public, saying the empowerment scheme is still being planned out.But Absa, which Barclays bought and merged with some of its African operations to form BGA in 2013, has previously offered 10% to black investors through its Batho Bonke empow- erment scheme, valued at over R5bn.With Barclays selling down its interest in BGA so that it ends up with less than 20% of the shares, there may only be 20.1% up for grabs.Asked whether Diamond is still interested in BGA given the latest developments, a spokesman for Atlas Merchant Capital, Diamond&rsquo;s investment vehicle, said: "It&rsquo;s &lsquo;no comment&rsquo; from us." He refused to be named.Jaap Meijer, an analyst at Arqaam Capital, says a book build is much more likely than finding a strategic buyer. "Basel 3 makes taking a stake highly punitive if it exceeds 10% of the capital of the group buying."Meanwhile, Abraaj CEO Arif Naqvi, who told Bloomberg TV he was interested in buying a share of the bank in January, has since ignored messages about this."Barclays has publicly stated it wants to be involved in BGA&rsquo;s operations. This implies a stake of below 20%," says Adrian Cloete, a portfolio manager at PSG Wealth.The two banking groups have said a level below 20% would serve to deconsolidate BGA from Barclays&rsquo; accounts.Cloete says: "It is possible, or even likely, that Barclays will retain a 15% or 20% stake in BGA."It is also theoretically possible that a Chinese bank, for example, could buy a 15% or 20% shareholding in BGA, but this would probably require [Reserve Bank] approval."Cloete also ruled out a bid by another foreign bank for the full 50% stake, pointing out that it would not make sense, as banking regulations would require the foreign bank to hold capital as if it owned 100% of the bank, while receiving only 50% of the earnings.Cloete says it is unlikely BGA would have two strategic shareholders. If Barclays were to retain a 15% to 20% stake, it is doubtful that another shareholder would pick up about 10% or 20% of the shares."It&rsquo;s either one or the other; but up to now there has been no talk of a strategic investor other than the current one, Barclays."Barclays was able to offload 12% of its shares through an overnight book build with money managers last year, which Cloete believes is a fair way to dispose of the shares, given that it includes all investors instead of selected institutions.Analysts expect a quick selldown to be positive for Barclays. "A quicker than expected sell-down of [the African business]... could create upside risk on a one-year view," Raul Sinha, a JPMorgan Cazenove equities analyst based in London, says in a research note.John Storey and Behrin Naidoo, Johannesburg-based analysts at JPMorgan Cazenove, say BGA shareholders were more focused on the Barclays selldown instead of its results for the year to December, when it reported a 5% increase to R14.9bn in headline earnings last week."The key overhang on valuations remains the uncertainty regarding the future strategy of the group without the support from its parent," they say. "We view the results as something of a sideshow as we believe investors will be more focused on the future strategy of Barclays Africa with the planned [exit or selldown] of Barclays."BGA CEO Maria Ramos had to field questions about the bank s plans and strategy at the presentation of the company s results, along with awkward questions about the bank s errant traders and a public protector investigation into Absa s Bankorp buyout in 1992.After she apologised for the bank s role in colluding to rig the market for the rand-dollar currency pair, journalists asked Ramos three times about the case and BGA s co-operation agreement with the commission.At the third questioning, she said: "I know you are just doing your jobs, and I know you have to ask these questions, but believe me when I say there are things I cannot discuss."She also said the office of the public protector should be respected.Ramos has strong political links. In the past she was an economist in the ANC s department of economic planning, and was involved in drafting the finance chapter of the interim constitution.She said she did not want to be drawn into a debate "about what the public protector did or did not do right".
