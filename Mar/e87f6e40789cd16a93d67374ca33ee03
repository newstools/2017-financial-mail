Tim Ferriss hardly needs an introduction. The self-help guru and number one New York Times bestselling author&rsquo;s self-improvement and productivity tricks have garnered him an almost cult-like status among the working m&eacute;nage.Ferriss labels his latest 650-page tome &mdash; Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines and Habits of Billionaires, Icons and World-class Performers &mdash; a buffet table, rather than a sit-down meal. In doing so, he encourages readers to skip bits according to their preferences.There really is something for everyone &mdash; and I mean everyone. There is a slow-carb diet cheat sheet, three tips from a Google pioneer and a chapter on &ldquo;How to Say &lsquo;No&rsquo; When It Matters Most&rdquo;.Through three tidy sections &mdash; healthy, wealthy and wise &mdash; Ferriss proffers words of wisdom from bigwigs he&rsquo;s interviewed over the years (think author Paulo Coelho, Twitter boss Jack Dorsey and Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn). He also shares his own life hacks, some of which devotees of his previous book, The 4-Hour Workweek, have come to swear by.
