Art collectors will have the rare opportunity to get their hands on limited-edition prints of great works of SA artists that go on sale at a pop-up shop next month.The prints, by artists such as Walter Battiss, Lucky Sibaya, Cecil Skotnes, Fred Schimmel, Judith Mason and Dirk Meerkotter were made by Schimmel himself in the 1970s when he founded the Graphic Club.The club was aimed at giving entry-level collectors an accessible way of owning investment art. The artists made screenprints of their works that are signed, dated and editioned.After Schimmel died in 2009, the club was resurrected by his daughter Gail, who has now made the original collection available through the pop-up shop which will be held at Parktown High School for Girls on April 2, starting at 9am.
