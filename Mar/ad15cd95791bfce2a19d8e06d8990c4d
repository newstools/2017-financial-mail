The constitutional court, led by chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, once again rides to the defence of the law of the land, much to the chagrin of President Jacob Zuma and his close ally, social development minister Bathabile Dlamini. The court struck a blow for accountability as a key constitutional value by ordering Dlamini to spell out every three months how she plans to ensure social grants are paid after the Cash Paymaster Services contract expires in a year. And to explain why she personally should not pay the costs of the case.Another week, another set of developments underlining Jacob Zuma s poor judgment and la-la land grasp of reality. His blithe call on the nation to "relax" over welfare payments was given short shrift by the constitutional court, which saw the matter as a "national crisis" and flayed his social development minister. The high court upheld a finding that Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza was dishonest and lacked integrity, and that the police minister ignored this finding. The SABC, left floundering for years, faces financial collapse.
