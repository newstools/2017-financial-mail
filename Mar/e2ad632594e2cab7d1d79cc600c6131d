What should SA&rsquo;s post-apartheid aesthetics look like?Many feel that it is far too early to pronounce on, but photographer Andrew Tshabangu may well be setting the tone of that debate with his exhibition, Footprints.Though the Standard Bank Gallery in Johannesburg s CBD may be an apt venue, Tshabangu s lens extends much further than the confines of the city, up Africa s east coast to Mozambique, Malawi and even R union Island, and as far afield as New York City.Interspersed among the pictures of busy public spaces and mundane rituals such as washing clothes and carrying firewood are fascinating photographs of religious pilgrimages and devout ceremonies.Footprints runs until April 29.
