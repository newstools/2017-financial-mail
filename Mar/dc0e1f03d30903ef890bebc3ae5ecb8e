&nbsp;Remgro, the R150bn investment giant controlled by the Rupert family, appears to be developing a strong connection with Community Investment Ventures Holdings (CIVH) &mdash; an empowerment group with a technology bent.CIVH&rsquo;s main asset is Dark Fibre Africa (DFA), which builds, installs, maintains and finances fibre-optic networks across SA.By the end of September last year DFA &mdash; which started operations in 2007 &mdash; had rolled out 9,503km of fibre network in major metropolitan areas and on long-haul routesIn the interim period to end-December, Remgro invested another R329m into CIVH (via a rights issue), pushing its stake in the company&nbsp;to 51%.While the investment in CIVH/DFA is one of Remgro&rsquo;s smaller holdings, it must rank as one of the best investments the group has made in the past decade.The value of the CIVH investment was pushed up 23% to R3.9bn in the interim period, with DFA s contribution to Remgro s headline earnings increasing 25.7% to R44m.Remgro s investment presentation showed that DFA increased revenue 37% to R734m and Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) by 43% to R495m.Remgro CEO Jannie Durand says DFA s improved results are mainly as a result of the solid growth in annuity income of 29%.Annuity stems from renting and maintenance of the fibre optic network. Corporates are the main customers, but so is pretty much anyone who wants fast Internet.DFA s annuity income is in excess of R101m/month. The book value of the fibre-optic network is estimated at more than R7.4bn.Durand estimates the future value of DFA s current annuity contract base is in excess of R18bn.Remgro s quandary as regards its interest in CIVH/DFA is that the investment is overshadowed by its mainstay portfolio of listed holdings like Mediclinic International, FirstRand/RMB, Distell, RCL Foods and RMI.At the recent investment presentation there was a question around whether Remgro would bundle its fast-growing smaller investments into a separately listed vehicle as had been done in the late 1990s with Venfin (which held the group s stakes in Vodacom, e.tv and Dimension Data).In terms of a possible technology specialist infrastructure hub, it s worth noting that Remgro also owns a 30% stake in Seacom, the undersea cable specialist. In terms of the agreement between Seacom s shareholders, only limited financial disclosure is allowed. Seacom s headline loss of R18m (2015: R28m) was mainly due to a change in the estimated useful life of the network assets and the subsequent normalisation of the depreciation charge.Remgro values its stake in Seacom at R1bn.The inferred value of CIVH/DFA is alone more than R7.6bn meaning it is a fast-growing enterprise that will certainly attract widespread market interest.Durand says though Remgro s investment portfolio is constantly reviewed, there are no plans for a Venfin-type separate listing.
