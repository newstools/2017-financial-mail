Hlaudi Motsoeneng was removed from his post as chief operating officer after the supreme court of appeal dismissed his bid to appeal a 2015 ruling by Judge Dennis Davis in the Western Cape high court, in a case brought by the DA.Davis had ruled that communications minister Faith Muthambi&rsquo;s decision to appoint him permanent COO in July 2014 was irrational and illegal, and should be set aside. This was because the public protector had found that Motsoeneng should face a disciplinary hearing, including for lying about his qualifications. Davis left the door open for Motsoeneng to be reappointed if he was absolved by the hearing.Motsoeneng was acquitted at a hearing in December 2015, but the DA launched a court challenge to this finding too.After losing his appeal last September, Motsoeneng returned to his old job as head of corporate affairs, then occupied by his close ally Sully Motsweni, who was moved to head of sport. But the DA also challenged this appointment and in November 2016 the court ruled he could not hold any post at the SABC until the public protector&rsquo;s report was set aside by a court or disciplinary proceedings against him were finalised. The SABC&rsquo;s leave to appeal this order was dismissed last month.This means the only chance Motsoeneng has of keeping his job &mdash; any job &mdash; at the SABC is if a court overturns the public protector&rsquo;s findings against him on review, or if he is cleared again in a second disciplinary hearing.Last week SABC acting CE James Aguma confirmed the broadcaster had approached the high court to challenge the public protector&rsquo;s findings. But a new interim board might reverse this decision.Meanwhile, Motsoeneng is preparing himself for his second disciplinary hearing."Hlaudi Motsoeneng is still an employee of the SABC," says his lawyer, Zola Majavu. "It&rsquo;s not over by a long shot."
