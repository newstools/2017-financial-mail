The share price of empowerment counter Grand Parade Investments (GPI) had, at the time of writing, risen about 10% since the recent release of interim results to end-December.The spurt might be attributed not only to GPI&rsquo;s concerted effort to present a clear break-down on intrinsic net asset value (NAV), but also to the fact that the key investment in fast-food brand Burger King is slowly turning profitable and, perhaps more importantly, that the company has started buying back its own shares in meaningful tranches.In the interim period GPI bought back 24.5m of its own shares for R89.4m (at an average price of R3.65/share), and then bought back another 8.9m shares for R32m (at an average price of R3.55/share) after the close of the interim accounts.The share buyback looks like a no-brainer, considering GPI states an intrinsic NAV of 682c/share on its investments. Aside from Burger King, these include a 12% stake in restaurant franchiser Spur Corp and catering business Mac Brothers, as well as a significant minority stake in the GrandWest and Worcester casinos plus a 30% stake in limited payout machine (LPM) operator GPI Slots.The company s investment presentation does a great job of unpacking the intrinsic NAV, which is incredibly helpful, as only Spur is listed on the JSE.Interestingly, the 15% stake in SunWest International, which operates the cash-spinning GrandWest casino in Cape Town, remains GPI s largest investment. The value is estimated at R875m equivalent to 199c/share or about 29% of the intrinsic NAV.Using a discounted cash flow method, GPI values its 91.1% stake in the 70-outlet Burger King at R660m (equivalent to about 150c/share or 23% of intrinsic NAV).Combining the intrinsic values of the controlling stake in Burger King with the minority stake in SunWest with the net cash holdings of R300m (68c/share) would give an intrinsic value of about 417c/share.At the ruling share price, this means a discount on the two main assets and the cash pile, and it offers investors free access to the more than R600m investment in the highly profitable LPM operations, the R135m holding in Spur, the promising Mac Brothers (worth R117m), Grand Foods Meat Plant (R63m) and properties worth R268m. Then there is the 15% stake in the Worcester casino (R25m), as well as the fledgling specialist eateries Dunkin Donuts (R11m) and Baskin-Robbins (R5m) that can t be entirely ignored.A discount of close to 45% seems extremely dismissive of GPI s prospects specifically its ability to generate succulent returns from Burger King. In essence, the market appears to be pencilling in the eventual sale of the remaining gaming assets, these combined values effectively adding up to more than 340c/share.So, put another way, the market is valuing the Spur minority stake, Burger King, the food service/catering assets and the properties at just 50c/share.That simply can t be right unless punters are taking the most jaundiced view of SA s fast-food and convenience restaurant sectors.Despite a slower than expected rollout of stores, it s getting increasingly difficult to make dire pronouncements on Burger King. With its rollout slowed down, GPI has been meticulous about preserving margins, and in the interim period only three corporate-owned restaurants and one franchised restaurant opened. Two corporate restaurants were closed after poor performances, which underlines GPI s insistence on securing acceptable returns at store level.The interim period saw Burger King post R5.6m at a company earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) level before one-off closure costs. This is an encouraging swing from the R13.4m loss in the corresponding interim period last year.Most heartening is that interim sales from Burger King s corporate restaurants were up more than 40%, to R318m, on the back of an 11% improvement in the average monthly restaurant sales and an increase in store numbers. GPI believes Burger King should be self-funding from the 2018 financial year, with the internal rate of return hurdle set at 20% per restaurant.Dunkin Donuts (five stores) and Baskin-Robbins (two stores) have not generated as much of a stir as Burger King. But early indications are that the launch of both brands in the Western Cape went well and that early sales were beating targets.However, the market focus will still be mainly on Burger King, which has 18 sites ready for rollout this year. It seems one key strategic tweak will be a focus on "drive-thru" outlets, and 14 of the next 18 Burger King openings will be in this convenient format.The other key indicator to monitor this financial year is how much the Ebitda margin is fattened. In financial 2016 the margin increased to 13.38% from 10.42%, and there must be considerable scope to beef this up further.Another point of intrigue will be whether GPI uses its balance sheet to acquire more Spur shares in the open market. Gut feel is that the more influential GPI becomes as a shareholder at Spur, the more likely that there will be an appetite for merging all or parts of GPI s food assets into Spur in exchange for additional scrip.There is a lot on GPI s plate for the medium term, but the Financial Mail reckons the stock is low-risk fare for long-term investors not wanting to suffer indigestion from growth prospects that are too rich.
