Since it was first created in 1817 as a special order for the future King George IV of England, Hennessy VSOP has always looked for unique pairings for its limited Cognac range.In recent years the brand has turned to artists, and the latest Privil&egrave;ge Heritage range of artwork for the bottle is created by the Carnovsky studio. The studio was founded by Italian-born Francesco Rugi and Colombian-born Silvia Quintanilla.The Cognac edition is Hennessy&rsquo;s first foray into the world of virtual animation. Rugi and Quintanilla use the colours of red, green and blue (RGB), and images from the Hennessy VSOP history to the tell the story through various layers, which can be viewed through coloured filters. An illustrated leaflet and the filters are included in the box.Customers will also be invited to craft their own RGB symbol, which will be incorporated by Carnovsky into artwork for them.Hennessy&rsquo;s VSOP Privil&egrave;ge Heritage range goes on sale in SA in April. The 750ml bottle will retail for R649.95.
