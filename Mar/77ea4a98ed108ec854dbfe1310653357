Whenever there is hail in the north and drought in the south, Santam has the broadest financial exposure to SA&rsquo;s testy weather.The group&rsquo;s underwriting ratio fell because of this from 9.6% in 2015 to 6.4% in 2016, which CEO Liz&eacute; Lambrechts says is in the middle of Santam&rsquo;s target range.It is a number that would certainly make its main rival, Mutual &amp; Federal, green with envy. And Lambrechts admits there was a lot of luck in the 2015 result.Only one of Santam&rsquo;s asset classes made a loss in 2016 &mdash; the guarantee business had a R31m loss. The guarantee business, not to be confused with Credit Guarantee, offers surety bonds such as construction guarantees as well as court bonds. But there were some divisions that will want to forget about 2016.Property, usually the second-largest contributor after motor, saw its underwriting surplus fall by more than 90% to a highly modest&nbsp;R22m. There was a slew of large commercial property claims.Ironically, Santam patted itself on the back for increasing its property premium sales by 11%, though some of this was into newly profitable areas such as the rest of Africa and Asia, as well as its reinsurer, Santam Re.There was very low growth in many of the specialist sectors, which are the key differentiators between Santam and its less successful competitors.Construction premiums increased by 2%, transport premiums fell by 1% and liability, in which Santam&rsquo;s SHA had limited competition, fell by 9%.Now such fledgling liability players as Camargue and Hollard at least appear in Internet searches. SHA has exited the difficult medical malpractice area and this has improved the quality of the book.The underwriting profit increased by nearly 30% to R301m, making it the largest contributor to profit after motor &mdash; though as a percentage of premium its return was about five times higher.Motor, excluding the benefit from the fast-growing MiWay business, increased premiums by just 4% to R11bn. But in a sector in which many insurers continue to make losses, it was an achievement that underwriting profit fell by just 8% to R622m.Within that, MiWay&rsquo;s underwriting result barely changed at R160m. It now accounts for more than 20% of the group&rsquo;s motor book. It also makes up one-third of the entire personal lines underwriting profit.Finance director Hennie Nel says the stability of the motor book is partly the result of discontinuing business in most outsourced platforms &mdash; this is where the broker is given full responsibility for underwriting, so Santam has no control over the quality of business.It also covered itself from last year&rsquo;s hail events through its reinsurance programme, both catastrophe and sideways cover (what used to be known in the premillennial world as proportional reinsurance).But the weather in SA is no longer the best single indicator of Santam&rsquo;s prospects. SA&rsquo;s largest short-term insurer now has no less than 35% of its shareholders&rsquo; funds invested in its partnership with Sanlam Emerging Markets.For Santam, the investment in the Morocco-based Saham Finances accounts for the bulk of this, 19%, with the remaining 16% in a range of insurers in Africa, India and Southeast Asia. For now they have limited impact on the income statement as only the growth and decline in their holding value is reflected.P&amp;O Insurance in Malaysia had an R88m decline due to lower premium growth, Soras in Rwanda was written down by R47m after fraud, but the holding in Shriram General in India increased in value by R51m.Saham is a key strategic diversification, bringing some relatively developed African markets such as Morocco into Sanlam&rsquo;s sphere of influence.Lambrechts says that while the Santam board is right behind the Saham investment, it thought that 35% exposure to international markets was sufficient. "We did not take up an additional allocation when new shares were made available to the Sanlam Group in December."Lambrechts says Santam will diversify its distribution from traditional brokers (though they will remain important partners) through its fledgling Santam Direct business, as well as the Sanlam agents &mdash; taken as a block they are already Santam&rsquo;s single largest source of business &mdash; as well as MiWay business insurance and the confusingly named MiWay Broker-Direct. Perhaps the robo-adviser is not far behind.
