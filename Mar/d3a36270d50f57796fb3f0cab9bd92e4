With less than a month left before the contract to distribute social grants to 17m South Africans runs out, the Black Sash has petitioned the constitutional court to urgently intervene in the mess.It&rsquo;s a disaster that has shown up rank incompetence on the part of social development minister Bathabile Dlamini, who also chairs the ANC Women&rsquo;s League.Three years ago, Dlamini and the SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) were ordered to run a new tender for the distribution of grants as the previous award to Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) was declared &ldquo;invalid&rdquo; by the court.But they sat on their hands. Now, three years later, the five-year contract with CPS is due to expire on March 31, and Dlamini&rsquo;s department has made no plans on how to distribute grants thereafter.Finally this week, on the same day that the Black Sash lodged its application, Sassa approached the constitutional court to ask it to approve a transitional arrangement to allow CPS to keep paying the grants until March next year.CEO Thokozani Magwaza said Sassa s efforts to run a new tender have been unsuccessful and its own ability to administer the grants is presently limited .Dlamini seems to have wanted this all along. She has lobbied extensively for extending CPS s contract on an emergency basis at a steep cost to the taxpayer. Serge Belamant, who runs CPS s parent company Net1 UEPS, realises he has government over a barrel, and says he ll only sign a new deal if his fee is hiked.Sassa withdrew the constitutional court&nbsp;application on Wednesday due to "inputs not being included". Sassa spokesman&nbsp;Kgomotso Diseko said it would be relodged but could not say when this would happen.&nbsp;The Black Sash, whose clients include tens of thousands of grant recipients, says, given the shambolic handling of the matter, the court should take an immediate &ldquo;supervisory role&rdquo; over both Dlamini and Sassa.Lynette Maart, a director of the Black Sash Trust, said in an affidavit that because government has &ldquo;inexplicably&rdquo; only acted now, &ldquo;there is no longer any alternative but for it to contract with CPS&rdquo;.As a result, a lucrative state contract will fall into CPS&rsquo;s lap by default, without any competitive tender process being run.This is &ldquo;an impermissible deviation from the constitutional requirements of a fair, equitable, transparent and cost-effective competitive public procurement&rdquo;, she says.Maart is scathing in her court papers. Sassa has &ldquo;breached its constitutional obligations of transparency and accountability to the public, to parliament, and to the court&rdquo;, she says. Equally, Dlamini &ldquo;has not performed her constitutional and statutory oversight function in respect of Sassa&rdquo;.The Black Sash is one of a number of parties that have watched with dismay as the deadline looms. Sassa&rsquo;s officials, who&rsquo;ve appeared before numerous parliamentary committees, seem fatigued by the continual embarrassment.There is now a tangible figure to what Dlamini s failure to do her job will cost the taxpayer: R1.3bn/year.This is the difference between the R2bn/year that CPS was paid to distribute grants under the previous contract and the R3.4bn that it will cost to keep the company doing the job on an emergency basis for one year.This sum emerged from a letter written by Sassa to national treasury, which specifies a fee of R22-R25 per grant recipient per month for an interim arrangement with CPS. This is some way above the R16.40 per beneficiary per month, that governs the current contract.This week Dlamini s close confidant at Sassa, Zodwa Mvulane, acknowledged to parliament s standing committee on public accounts that the agency is facing an emergency.However, Sassa stopped short of admitting it was responsible for this disaster.Discussing the increased fee, Mvulane said a provision would have to be made for an increase linked to inflation. But the problem is that finance minister Pravin Gordhan s budget last week made no provision for such an increase.In a token bid to reassure the committee that Sassa wouldn t be a pushover when it comes to negotiating the fee with Belamant, Mvulane said the services of an actuary would be used.However, this week as with many appearances before parliament a number of key officials at Sassa or within Dlamini s department failed to arrive to answer questions.Magwaza didn t pitch apparently due to ill health, though there were rumours he d been suspended by Dlamini (which he denied). His offence? Approaching the SA Post Office to discuss a possible distribution option.Also missing from this week s meeting was Dlamini herself.
