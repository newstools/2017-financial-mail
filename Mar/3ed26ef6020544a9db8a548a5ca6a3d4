The Logi Circle from Logitech is a Wi-Fi-enabled streaming camera designed for remote home surveillance. It&rsquo;s pint-sized and, frankly, rather cute in design, with a round "eye" and base that fits in your hand.Hooked up to the app, it streams up to 1080p video to a device of your preference (iOS and Android, or via a desktop Web app) so you can see what&rsquo;s going on in your home when you&rsquo;re away, through a 135&deg; wide-angle view.Like most smart home devices, connectivity for the Circle is via your home Wi-Fi. The, ahem, net effect of this is that it is not "data-lite" and is best suited to homes with high-cap or uncapped ADSL and fibre Internet.From a usability perspective, a top selling point is how simple the set-up is. You can be up-and-streaming in a couple of minutes.The device can be placed anywhere inside your home that has decent Wi-Fi-coverage, and will last for a number of hours (dependent on settings) on battery power (up to 12 hours on power-saving mode). With this in mind, I found that it works best on the charger platform &mdash; especially if you&rsquo;re going to be away for more than the work day.It connects to the platform via a strong magnet, so you can mount this vertically if that offers the best vantage point.It&rsquo;s not only about security. Logitech promotes the use of this device for checking in on pets and kids when you&rsquo;re away. It&rsquo;s capable of two-way communication, and you can even save snaps and short videos directly off the app. I like the 30-second recap of the day&rsquo;s activities option, and there are more options (like person detection and custom alerts), as well as additional storage options available with a US$9.99 monthly subscription.It comes in black and white models, and retails for around R3,999 from Incredible Connection.Logitech Circle Cool factor &nbsp;*** Usability ***** Value for money ****
