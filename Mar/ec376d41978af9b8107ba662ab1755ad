Though the slow food movement is seen as a recent development, it is in fact about 30 years old.At its heart lies the philosophy that all people should access and enjoy food that is good for them, good for the planet and good for the people who grow it.This year the Serengeti Eat-In slow food festival will attempt to embrace all these concepts, with 10 of Gauteng&rsquo;s best chefs participating. Among them are Adele Stiehler-van der Westhuizen (Prue Leith), James Diack (Coobs), James Khoza (Sandton Convention Centre) and Kalpesh Hansjee (Michelangelo).Each chef will prepare a different cut from an Nguni carcass, making use of the entire animal &ldquo;from nose to tail&rdquo;.The animal has been sourced from Victoria Dzowa, who farms indigenous Nguni cattle near Magaliesburg. Nguni cattle have been registered by the Slow Food organisation as a breed threatened by industrialisation and that is of particular cultural importance in SA.By encouraging the nose-to-tail concept, the organisers hope to encourage consumers to use underutilised cuts of meat and show greater respect for the animals and humans that brought them to the plate.The Eat-In will be held at the Serengeti Golf &amp; Wildlife Estate in Kempton Park on Saturday March 25 from 10am to 5pm.Tickets are R335 per person (R295 for members) and include five randomly selected coupons for a different plate of Nguni beef as well as one ticket for a secondary (offal) cut. There will be a full cash bar at the event.
