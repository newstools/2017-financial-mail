&nbsp;It was a secret shared only among bread lovers in Johannesburg, but word is out. Babette&rsquo;s Bread in the Maboneng precinct of the city centre has built up a reputation as one of the best artisanal bread bakeries in the city.The shop takes its name from owner and baker Babette Kourelos, a law graduate who learnt her trade at the hands of a French baker in Vermont.She bakes and sells most breads, such as rye, ciabatta and French sourdough, and the shop in Maboneng is also a small caf&eacute; serving good coffee and sandwiches.Depending on the quantity, there is also a delivery service.Kourelos also hosts regular workshops and classes aimed at the home baker.
