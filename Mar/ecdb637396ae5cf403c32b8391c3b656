If they can&rsquo;t be trusted to pack envelopes, should we be trusting them with the global financial economy?If you listened closely during the enormous snafu at last week&rsquo;s Oscars ceremony, in between the gasps of shock you might have heard guffaws from people who&rsquo;ve long suspected that all of the "Big Four" audit firms are actually run by humans.This means that they not only make mistakes with envelopes, but that they also might not be quite as independent as they should be after decades-long client relationships.It&rsquo;s not just in Hollywood that the Big Four are finding themselves under attack. Across the globe regulators and concerned shareholders are trying to work out how to exert some control over what is possibly the most powerful, least transparent oligopoly in the world.That their options are limited became more evident when, in the wake of the Enron collapse in 2001, Arthur Andersen was forced to suffer the consequences of its inept auditing and the Big Five became the Big Four.The four left standing &mdash; Deloitte, PwC, EY and KPMG &mdash; became significantly more powerful (they audit more than 95% of the world&rsquo;s publicly traded companies), almost untouchable as watchdogs grew fearful that they might become the even bigger three.Almost, but not entirely.Every new corporate scandal prompts questions about the role of auditors and, in a growing number of cases, prompts fines as well as shareholders seeking financial compensation.Remarkably, as one commentator has noted, despite being implicated in so many scandals, the big audit firms manage to maintain a stodgy public image that oozes respectability.No doubt the public, including corporate clients, needs to believe the image as much as the Big Four need to promote it.The latest dent to that stodgy public image (hard on the heels of the Oscars meltdown) was the UK&rsquo;s Financial Reporting Council having to tell auditors last week to improve their quality control. This, after finding deficiencies in one-third of audits it reviewed.The results of the review should be seen in the context of the UK&rsquo;s move to implement mandatory rotation of audit firms. EU member states are also implementing mandatory rotation in a bid to break the cosy relationships that inevitably develop when audit contracts run to several decades.Last August, the prospect of mandatory rotation of audit firms finally came to SA&rsquo;s shores. As expected, the announcement by the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA) prompted a spirited response from an industry determined to maintain a way of life it has enjoyed for more than 100 years.The IRBA is proposing that, with effect from 2023, an audit firm will not serve as the registered auditor of a listed company for more than 10 consecutive years. After that there has to be at least a five-year break.The IRBA&rsquo;s primary objective is to promote independence and enhance audit quality.The proposal prompted squeals of indignation from several not unconnected lobby groups at a standing committee on finance meeting in parliament recently. Much of what was said in parliament was an echo of warnings issued against similar moves in other jurisdictions.Mandatory rotation is attempting to fix something that isn&rsquo;t broken, said Christine Ramon of the CFO Forum.It is a solution looking for a problem, echoed the International Federation of Accountants.The MPs were warned that implementing such disruptive measures at a time when the global economy is in turmoil will increase the high level of risk already facing companies. Time and again they were told that the costs of implementing the changes overseas have far exceeded the benefits.They were reminded that mandatory firm rotation elsewhere hasn&rsquo;t developed choice beyond the Big Four but resulted in companies hopping from one of the Big Four to another.For IRBA CEO Bernard Agulhas, this prospect has implications for the secondary objectives of the proposal: to promote transformation and reduce market concentration.While other jurisdictions were concerned about concentration levels, few, if any, have identified the need for transformation. It is likely to require additional specific measures in SA.The EFF&rsquo;s Floyd Shivambu also suggested that the long-term client relationships and the international profile of the Big Four creates a useful environment for setting up complex tax-avoidance schemes.Meanwhile, it seems shareholders may not have expressed views on auditor rotation because doing so would have been pointless.But since the IRBA announced its proposal last August, shareholders have become significantly more engaged on the issue. From less than a 1% vote against changing auditors, significant blocks of shareholders are now voting for change.At Spar&rsquo;s recent AGM a startling 36% of shareholders voted for change against 0.3% the previous year. At Lonmin it was 42%, up from 1.4% a year earlier. Barloworld, Woolworths, Astral, Tiger Brands, Aspen and Pioneer are just some of the companies whose shareholders now see a solution to a problem.Parliament doesn&rsquo;t actually get to have a say in the matter. It&rsquo;s all down to the IRBA. But that body is likely to be influenced by the considered views of the standing committee on finance.
