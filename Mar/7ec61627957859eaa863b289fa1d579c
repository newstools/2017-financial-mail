We question Prudence Lebina. CEO of GAIA Infrastructure Capital.What&rsquo;s the most interesting thing about you that people don&rsquo;t know?I was born with six fingers on my right hand.How do you handle stress?Exercise, prayer and sleep.What is your biggest indulgence?Chocolate fondant and Oros.What was your first job?Working at my aunt&rsquo;s shop in rural Limpopo over school holidays. Looking back, I learnt the value of hard work and realised that retail is hard and a volume-driven business. I guess this also influenced my later career choices and my decision to become a chartered accountant, ultimately leading to my current role.Which phrase or word do you most overuse?"Such is life" and "Wow ... that&rsquo;s ridiculous!"What&rsquo;s your one top tip for doing a deal?Deal with the current facts &mdash; don&rsquo;t over-predict the future, chances are that if you try to, you&rsquo;ll be wrong anyway.Where were you when Nelson Mandela was released from prison?I was nine years old so probably out playing in the streets of Soweto.What&rsquo;s the worst airport you&rsquo;ve been in?I find JFK the most impersonal and unfriendly of all the airports I have transited through. What I dislike most about it is everyone is on edge.What is the one investment you wish you had made, or made earlier?I wish I had invested in property, especially student accommodation.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a solid investment with long-term social benefits.Nominate your eighth wonder of the world.Fermented grapes ... some call it wine.What are you reading at the moment?Undeterred by Rania Habiby Anderson, a motivational read, inviting women to look inside themselves to find the strength to achieve their goals.What do you consider the most overrated virtue?Without hesitation &mdash; I believe diplomacy and patience are the quickest route to not getting anything done. Being overly diplomatic can lead to one biting one&rsquo;s tongue rather than taking a stand against what&rsquo;s wrong, leading to problems further down the line.When and where are you happiest?At home watching The Big Bang Theory or having lunch with my kids.Is there such a thing as "enough money" and, if so, how much is it?It&rsquo;s relative. Someone gave my 7-year-old R200 for his birthday and he shouted: "I&rsquo;m rich!"
