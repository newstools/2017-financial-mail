Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg was in a noticeably upbeat mood at the group&rsquo;s year-end presentation in London last week.It was a marked contrast to a year ago, when Glencore was under pressure from high debt levels and weak commodities prices.Glasenberg, a blunt and wily South African, is one of the world&rsquo;s richest men. He was getting richer last week as the group&rsquo;s share price responded to the promise of more dividends to come. His 8.4% personal stake in Glencore was worth (on paper) about R64bn at last week&rsquo;s price of R52/share, which gave Glencore a market capitalisation of about R760bn.Glencore&rsquo;s US$0.07/share distribution on the back of strong free cash flow, reduced debt and costs will cost the group US$1bn.In the current year it expects to pay a base dividend of $1bn from its marketing activities, reflecting the division&rsquo;s stable and predictable cash flows, and at least a quarter of the free cash flows from the industrial activities.At current spot prices the industrial business is generating about $4.5bn of free cash, which implies at least a doubling of the dividend for 2017 if prices remain steady.Glasenberg remains optimistic about the outlook for thermal coal to 2030, despite predictions from a number of analysts that it will be superseded in the global energy mix by renewable energy sources.The group produces domestic and export thermal coal and ferrochrome in SA. It is the biggest global producer of both commodities.While it is true that coal consumption in Europe and North America is declining, consumption of coal in Asia is increasing as new coal-fired power generation is coming on line, Glasenberg says.Even as coal s share of the global energy mix declines to 25% by 2030 from 29% in 2013, in volumes this still represents an increase to 5.8bnt from 5.6bnt.According to BP s latest Energy Outlook, China s coal demand is close to peaking and its energy consumption will decline as its economy is modernised.But it will still represent half of the global thermal coal market in 2035, using domestic coal and imports. BP expects global coal consumption to peak in the mid-2020s and its growth will be only 0.2%/year for the next 20 years, compared with 2.7%/year in the past 20.Glasenberg says China s policy makers had indicated they would control coal output to achieve a base price of about 550 yuan/t, equivalent to about $73/t out of the Australian port of Newcastle, which is a good price for Glencore.Glasenberg says demand for ferrochrome is strong. SA s chrome mines could substantially increase their production at current prices but logistical constraints could allow the market to remain buoyant for some time.Last week Glencore and Northam Platinum, as part of the sale of Glencore s Eland platinum mine to Northam, signed an offtake agreement under which Glencore will market all the chrome from Northam s Zondereinde and Booysendal mines.This is a good deal from both Northam and Glencore s points of view, Northam CEO Paul Dunne says. It gives Glencore access to the material and Northam access to Glencore s sales expertise, for which it will pay Glencore a market-related commission.Total chrome produced from Zondereinde, Booysendal and eventually Eland (which is now on care and maintenance) will be about 110,000t/month.In copper, strikes and technical issues at mines like Escondida in Chile and Grasberg in Indonesia have restrained growth in global output, Glasenberg says. As copper prices weakened, producers focused on mining higher-grade material, which will limit future supply. Global inventories are low. While new copper supply is coming on stream, grades at older mines are falling as resources are depleted.Expanded production from Glencore s Katanga and Mopani copper mines will come on stream next year and in 2019.
