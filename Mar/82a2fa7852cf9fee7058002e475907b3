In view of the spectacular way strikes brought the Post Office to a halt for four months in 2014, new CEO Mark Barnes is taking no chances. Much of his first year in the job was spent trying to settle management-worker relations and boosting morale."There were a lot of bullied and demotivated people and much of the infrastructure was dirty and inoperable," says Barnes, warning that the way back from the brink will be slow and hard work.Years of labour disputes had to be settled. Part-time and casual employees are being converted into permanent part-time staff and already staff costs are 70% of total costs. "It should be around 40%," says Barnes.Given his ambitions and difficulties around large-scale lay-offs, the hope is that productivity increases will bring the figure down.Communication Workers&rsquo; Union (CWU) president Clyde Mervin says things have stabilised "but relations are still strained and we need to engage on a lot of issues around the restructuring management wants to implement." Mervin is determined to see all casuals made permanent. He describes management &mdash; many of whom "don&rsquo;t fully understand the ICT revolution" &mdash; as being poorly organised and acting unilaterally. For example, allowances were ended without consultation. And there is still racism at regional level. "Some managers create havoc."The good news for Barnes is that the workers believe he is trying his best. CWU accepts the need for restructuring and the implications that might have for switching workers between departments, after consultation. Even better, Mervin seems as enthusiastic about growth prospects as Barnes. "We want to ensure we get a full banking licence and with our extensive footprint it makes sense that we get the SA Social Security Agency contract," he says.If government gave its business to the Post Office, and not to private companies, no bailout would ever be needed, says Mervin. "But we need proper management."
