Kuben Moodley was a special adviser to mineral resources minister Mosebenzi Zwane, who joined the Guptas on a trip to Switzerland to negotiate their purchase of Optimum coal mine from Glencore.Former public protector Thuli Madonsela found in her state capture report that Moodley&rsquo;s company Albatime had helped finance the Gupta deal. Her report said a business account at the Bank of Baroda received 32 deposits for Tegeta Exploration &amp; Resources, which is owned by the Guptas, their close business associate Salim Essa and President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s son Duduzane. The deposits, totalling R2.5bn, were received between December 2015, when the sale agreement was signed, and April 2016, when the money was paid. The list of depositors includes Albatime.Madonsela said Moodley&rsquo;s wife, Viroshini Naidoo, was a director of Eskom at the time as well as an employee of Albatime. She said Eskom had orchestrated the sale to the Guptas, including during a board meeting held in Cape Town in April 2015 attended by Moodley&rsquo;s wife as well as Mark Pamensky, the former COO of telecoms firm Blue Label. He left Blue Label in 2015 after joining the boards of Eskom and Gupta-owned Oakbay Resources &amp; Energy.Moodley and Pamensky were both directors of another company called BIT Technology. Pamensky was also associated with Shiva Uranium, in which Tegeta has a 20% stake; Yellow Star Trading 1099, of which Essa is a director; and ORE, which is 64% owned by Atul Gupta.Moodley said previously via e-mail that Albatime wasn&rsquo;t involved at all in the Optimum transactions "therefore there is no conflict", despite detailed evidence to the contrary in Madonsela&rsquo;s report.In its contract with the SABC, Moodley and Frans Basson&rsquo;s company LornaVision lists Blue Label&rsquo;s residential address, 75 Grayston Drive, Sandton, as its "principal place of business". Basson later explained this was because Blue Label Data Solutions, a division of Blue Label Telecoms Group, owned shares in the company that were sold to a trust whose registered beneficiaries are accountants based in Namibia.Journalists at amaBhungane have detailed further links between Moodley and Gupta business associates, including Essa.Moodley declined to respond to e-mailed questions about LornaVision&rsquo;s contract with the SABC or whether he had launched a challenge to review Madonsela&rsquo;s report linking him to Gupta businesses, saying his lawyer would "respond to your harassment".
