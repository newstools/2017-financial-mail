Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini caused outrage among MPs on Tuesday after she said she had to leave the meeting of Parliament's standing committee on public accounts to attend a Cabinet meeting.This was after giving a long explanation of about an hour about the developments leading to the current crisis regarding the payment of social grants after the contract with Net1 subsidiary Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) expires on March 31.EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi was particularly enraged by the minister's announcement, which meant MPs would not have an opportunity to ask questions.Eventually Dlamini agreed to stay for a few questions after committee chairman Themba Godi appealed to her for flexibility.The minister was called to the meeting to give a progress report on how more than R140bn in social grants to nearly 17-million beneficiaries will be paid on April 1, the day after the unlawful contract between the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and CPS expires.Godi opened the meeting saying the committee was concerned not only about whether social grants would be paid on April 1, but also about how things had got to this stage &nbsp;and how processes had been managed.The CPS contract had a time period and executives knew that at some time it would lapse. Explanations given had not been very conclusive.Dlamini admitted during her presentation that it was already known in October last year Sassa would not be able to meet the April 2017 deadline to take over the payment of social grants from CPS.The minister told MPs that the legal work stream - one of three established to work on the takeover of social grants by Sassa &nbsp;- advised Sassa and the Department of Social Development in October 2016 &nbsp;that Sassa would not meet the time frames of taking over social grants in April.In December the legal work stream again advised that Sassa would not be ready and said a report explaining the situation should be submitted to the Constitutional Court. The minister said the department and Sassa agreed to report to the Constitutional Court in January. This did not happen.This was the background for deciding to contract again with CPS which was the only service provider which could provide a seamless service after March 31.The minister said she had instructed the withdrawal of the affidavit submitted last Tuesday by Sassa CEO Thokazani Magawaza - now on sick leave - because she had not seen it as was her right.Legal advisers had advised that the Constitutional Court be informed of the challenges faced by Sassa.But there were a number challenges with Magwaza's affidavit, among them that &nbsp;CPS, Minister of FInance and Treasury were not cited as respondents."The affidavit shows that we have already decided as to who should do what. It does not give reasons as to why we are here today," Dlamini said."We felt we must apologise to the Constitutonal Court about the misunderstandings," she added. A subsequent report was submitted to the Court. &nbsp;The minister said negotiations had started with CPS for a two-year contract and a due diligence had been undertaken. A full report would be made by officials on Thursday.Dlamini said Treasury had instructed the Department of Social Development had to use its current budget for any new CPS contract. It would not get more.
