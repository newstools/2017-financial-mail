It&rsquo;s been a torrid decade for JSE-listed construction and engineering giant Murray &amp; Roberts. Since 2007, the SA icon has posted some big profits &mdash; but then tumbled into huge losses. And while there have been signs of a recovery in the construction sector, the sad reality is that even in the past three years, the company&rsquo;s turnover from its remaining business has plunged 24% from R34.6bn to R26.1bn in its past financial year.Its portfolio includes such landmarks as the Carlton Centre in Johannesburg (still Africa&rsquo;s tallest building); the Koeberg nuclear power station; the Gautrain; Cape Town&rsquo;s Greenpoint stadium; the gigantic Gorgon natural gas platform in Australia and perhaps most recognisable of all, the luxury sail-shaped Burj al Arab hotel in Dubai. But the iconic company that carried SA&rsquo;s construction reputation across the world is now no more. M&amp;R still exists, but it&rsquo;s been radically overhauled &mdash; a victim of the immense value destruction in the construction and engineering industries.For investors, it&rsquo;s been equally crushing. Anyone who invested R1m in Murray &amp; Roberts at its height in 2007 would now have stock worth just R141,000. In other words, investors would have lost 86% of their investment.This is a peek into Financial Mail's cover story on the anatomy of a fallen icon.&nbsp;If you are already a subscriber, please click on the following link below to go to the full article: Murray &amp; Roberts: The demise of an icon.If you would like to&nbsp;subscribe &nbsp;to BusinessLIVE Premium to read the full story, please&nbsp;click here: Subscribe.
