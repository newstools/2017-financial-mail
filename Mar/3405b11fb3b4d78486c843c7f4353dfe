Among the findings of a probe into the SABC&rsquo;s dire financial state that parliament is about to act on, are dubious contracts &mdash; including one to collect R1.7bn/year in unpaid licence fees awarded to a company with a distinctly convoluted mode of operating.James Aguma was in fine fettle when he appeared before parliament last week. The urbane acting chief executive of the SABC batted away awkward questions from MPs like flies on a hot summer&rsquo;s day.Was the SABC teetering on the brink of insolvency, as parliament&rsquo;s ad hoc inquiry has suggested? Rubbish, he said. The SABC boasted a net asset position of R2.7bn and a cash balance of R881m. Against these numbers a net loss of R411m could be considered almost trifling.What about the auditor-general&rsquo;s (AG) finding that the SABC had incurred cumulative irregular expenditure of R5.1bn? Legacy issues, said Aguma.Confidential documentsWhat he failed to mention was that the SABC&rsquo;s own budget review in November 2016 (seen by the Financial Mail) shows the broadcaster was planning for a loss of R1.1bn in 2018 and expected revenue to decline from R8bn in 2016 to R7.3bn in 2018.Confidential documents show the SABC&rsquo;s cash balance had fallen from R1bn in 2015 to R330m at the end of January 2017. And it spends R650m/month on operational costs.During the inquiry it became clear that irregular expenditure continued unabated under Aguma and Motsoeneng. Witnesses said they had abused their power to commit the broadcaster to a number of dubious deals and spent tens of millions on consultants that duplicated work of staffers.This is a peek into Financial Mail's cover story on the SABC.&nbsp;If you are already a subscriber, please click on the following link below to go to the full article: SABC broke and broken: How billions in TV licence fees go up in smoke.If you would like to&nbsp;subscribe &nbsp;to BusinessLIVE Premium to read the full story, please&nbsp;click here: Subscribe
