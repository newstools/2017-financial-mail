It’s been a torrid decade for JSE-listed construction and engineering giant Murray & Roberts. Since 2007, the SA icon has posted some big profits — but then tumbled into huge losses. And while there have been signs of a recovery in the construction sector, the sad reality is that even in the past three years, the company’s turnover from its remaining business has plunged 24% from R34.6bn to R26.1bn in its past financial year. Its portfolio includes such landmarks as the Carlton Centre in Johannesburg (still Africa’s tallest building); the Koeberg nuclear power station; the Gautrain; Cape Town’s Greenpoint stadium; the gigantic Gorgon natural gas platform in Australia and perhaps most recognisable of all, the luxury sail-shaped Burj al Arab hotel in Dubai.But the iconic company that carried SA’s construction reputation across the world is now no more. M&R still exists, but it’s been radically overhauled — a victim of the immense value destruction in the construction and engineering industries. For investors, it’s been equally crushing. Anyone who invested R1m in Murray & Roberts at its height in 2007 would now have stock worth just R141,000. In other words, investors would have lost 86% of their investment.
