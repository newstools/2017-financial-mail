Justice Malala’s reference to Malusi Gigaba (Inside Gigaba's 'president’s committee') has triggered further etymological research. A ba is the spirit of a deceased person, appearing in the guise of a human-headed bird and demanding offerings of food. The 2018 budget will doubtless show that a "gigaba" requires a billion times the offerings of an ordinary ba. However, a gigaba is not to be confused with "gigabaa" (the cumulative utterances of a National Prosecuting Authority chief), or indeed with "Gigabaas" (a respectful term of address used by government ministers when addressing their Saxonwold overlords).
