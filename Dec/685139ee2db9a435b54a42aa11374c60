If you are looking for a tipple to enjoy this festive season you may be surprised to find that local outfits are still top-notch. Stellenbosch has stood out as the region producing some of the world’s best wines, bubbly and brandies. In the Prescient Cabernet Sauvignon Report 2017, 14 of the 15 top wines selected came from Stellenbosch while in the Prescient Chardonnay Report 2017, 23 wines from the region made it into the top 42 that scored 90-95 points. At the Veritas Wine & Brandy Awards, Stellenbosch clinched 29 out of the 71 double golds. This year’s top three producers also come from SA’s premier wine region. For the second year running Stellenbosch-based Distell was named top achiever, with seven double golds and 18 golds. It also triumphed in the brandy category, with six double golds and two golds. Another famous local, Spier, received the first Veritas Vertex Award for the competition’s overall champion wine, the 21 Gables Chenin Blanc 2015, and was ranked second-best performer overall with six double golds and nine golds. In third spot was Kleine Zalze, with four double golds and four golds. In Platter’s SA Wine Guide, wines from Stellenbosch clinched 36 out of the 111 five-stars awarded. The guide’s Winery of the Year accolade went to a Stellenbosch producer, Raats Family Wine Estate, which garnered five five-star results — the most of any producer. At the Absa Pinotage Top 10, more than half the winners came from the region and this year the Diners Club Young Winemaker of the Year Award went to Proudly Stellenbosch ambassador, Wade Roger-Lund of Jordan Estate. On the global front, Stellenbosch took four of the six varietal trophies at the International Wine & Spirit Competition, while the SA Wine Producer of the Year Award went to Kanonkop, with the estate’s Abrie Beeslaar also named International Winemaker of the Year — an accolade he collected in 2008 and 2015.
