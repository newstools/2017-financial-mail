A message from the editor of the Financial Mail. This edition of the Financial Mail is something different. For only the second time in our history, we’ve put together an entire digital-only magazine for the festive season. Given the dramatic ANC elective conference this week, we felt it was our duty to provide a comprehensive analytical account of what happened at Nasrec, and what this means for our country. Click below to read the e-zine. Click on square in the bottom-right corner to read it in full screen or e arrow in the top-left to download and read it offline. So, inside our magazine you’ll read how Cyril Ramaphosa was able to swing the election his way, as well as about the machinations of the missing votes that elevated Ace Magashule to the position of secretary-general, and what took place behind the scenes of, arguably, the most important ANC election since SA’s shift to democracy. As our cover image makes explicit, Ramaphosa’s poisoned chalice includes three of the less-salubrious elements of the ruling party: the compromised Magashule, the thuggish David Mabuza and the clueless Jessie Duarte. The trick is what Ramaphosa can do now, given those constraints. Elsewhere in the magazine, we explore how Steinhoff’s fortunes have darkened following revelations last week that the furniture retailer’s top brass just doesn’t know what it doesn’t know; a new assault on Naspers by Swiss hedge fund manager Albert Saporta; and how the Guptas haven’t paid for their jet, which was used to carry politicians around the world. There’s a lot more besides, so download the magazine and read it on your tablet, phone or computer. And we’ll be back on shelves in the second week of January. Have a great festive season.
