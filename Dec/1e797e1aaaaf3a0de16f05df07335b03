FirstRand chairman Laurie Dippenaar, who is one of the founders of the bank, will retire at the end of March next year and will be succeeded by Roger Jardine. Dippenaar tells Business Day TV why Jardine was chosen as his successor. The bank had said its original plan was for FirstRand’s former CEO, Sizwe Nxasana, to take the position. But due to Nxasana’s civil society and investment activities, Primedia CEO, Jardine will take the reins. Jardine has been a non-executive director on various boards within the FirstRand group for the past 13 years.
