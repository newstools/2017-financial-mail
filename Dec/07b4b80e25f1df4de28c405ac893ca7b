The Maynardville Open-Air Festival of theatre, ballet and classical music kicks off in January with a decidedly Shakespearean theme. The theatre production this year is the Taming of the Shrew by Tara Notcutt, and produced by Siv Ngesi, with an all-female cast and a 2018 pop treatment of the comedy which is bound to shake theatre-goers from their comfort zones. For classical music fans, there is a special treat. From January 18 to January 20 the Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra (CPO) will feature some of the most popular music set to the bard’s plays. Under the baton of Brandon Phillips, with narration by Rodney Trudgeon, there will be Nicolai’s Merry Wives of Windsor as well as Romeo and Juliet with music by Tchaikovsky, Berlioz and Prokofiev. The CPO is followed by a season of ballet — Les Sylphides and The Firebird with Cape Town City Ballet. Maynardville Open-Air Festival January 18-March 3
