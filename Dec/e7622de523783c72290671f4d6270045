Recent changes to Mauritius’s property investment legislation have made it easier for South Africans to invest in property on the Indian Ocean island. St Antoine Private Residence, close to Grand Baie on the north of the island, is one of the new developments available to foreign buyers. It boasts luxury apartments and penthouses with two, three or four bedrooms, and a clubhouse with a swimming pool, children’s play area, deli, bar, lounge, beauty salon and spa, as well as a boat yard and storage. Just over an hour’s drive from Cape Town, the unspoilt West Coast village of Yzerfontein is increasingly on the radar of Capetonians and international buyers looking for a weekend or holiday getaway. This luxury holiday house with sweeping views of Dassen Island and the Atlantic Ocean offers double-volume living areas, fireplaces, wooden floors, four bedrooms, walk-through bathroom and a self-contained cottage.
