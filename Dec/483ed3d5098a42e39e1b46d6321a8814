He was born in Cape Town and is intimately involved in the art community of the Mother City as co-founder of the Gugulective, an artist-led collective. He was also the inaugural winner of the Spier Contemporary Award in 2007, so it is only fitting that Kemang Wa Lehulere should have an exhibition of his latest works opening in Cape Town in the new year. Here I am, a Concrete Man, Throwing Himself into Abstraction is a solo exhibition in which Wa Lehulere explores new visual materials. Wood is deconstructed and singed, metal is reconstituted and glass is weighted as the artist exploits familiar materials to create unexpected objects. Wa Lehulere has exhibited widely around the world, including in London, Chicago and Berlin, as well as in SA. He has won several top awards, including the 2015 Standard Bank Young Artist Award for Visual Art, the 2010 MTN New Contemporaries Award and the 2012 Tollman Award for the Visual Arts. Wa Lehulere is Deutsche Bank’s Artist of the Year for 2017 and was recently the recipient of the fourth Malcolm McLaren Award, presented at Performa 17 in New York. • Here I am, a Concrete Man, Throwing Himself into Abstraction will be at Cape Town’s Stevenson Gallery from January 18 to March 10
