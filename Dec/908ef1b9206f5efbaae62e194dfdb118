Dreams really do come true if you believe in them enough. SA hip hop star Cassper Nyovest made history on Saturday as his #FillUpFNBStadium show sold over 68,000 tickets — more than some international artists who have performed at the stadium in previous years, such as Justin Bieber and Rihanna. The local rapper missed his target of 75,000 tickets, but that did not stop the positive energy and overwhelming support from fans and celebrities such as Somizi Mhlongo, as he belted out hits from his album Thuto. President of the Black Business Council Danisa Baloyi found herself suspended, pending an investigation into the whereabouts of a R5m donation from the Airports Company SA (Acsa) that was meant to fund the council’s transformation lobbying programme. It seems the missing millions, which were supposed to be paid into the group’s bank account, only came to light after the council had tapped Acsa for more. Baloyi denies any wrongdoing and is co-operating with the investigation.
