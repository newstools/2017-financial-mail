The world-renowned St Petersburg Ballet returns to Johannesburg next week with performances of two of Tchaikovsky’s much-loved ballets, Swan Lake and The Nutcracker. The score will be performed live by the Johannesburg Festival Orchestra. The Vaganova-trained dancers are internationally acclaimed and the two ballets are part of the company’s vast repertoire, which includes such classical masterpieces as Giselle, Don Quixote, La Bayadère, Les Sylphides, Paquita and Sleeping Beauty. The 60-member company is so popular that it gives about 250 performances around the world each year. Lavish sets and costumes accompany the troupe on its travels. Swan Lake opens at the Teatro at Montecasino on Friday September 15, and The Nutcracker premieres on Friday September 22. The performances end on September 24. There are also matinee performances scheduled.
