Six award-winning shows from Cape Town’s Baxter Theatre Centre are on the bill for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland this month. The six dramas at the festival, which runs from August 3-27, are Lara Foot’s Tshepang: The Third Testament No Fathers, The Inconvenience of Wings and The Fall; Sylvaine Strike’s Tobacco; and Yäel Farber’s Mies Julie. This comes as the Baxter celebrates its 40th anniversary on August 1 as one of SA’s top venues for contemporary and classic theatre works. The iconic theatre came into being as a result of a bequest from the late William Baxter who, in his will, bequeathed an amount of money to the University of Cape Town for establishing a theatre that would "develop and cultivate the arts in Cape Town and the adjacent districts for all artists". Despite the apartheid segregation laws, the theatre was always open to all people at a time when SA was hugely divided. Commenting on both honours last week, Baxter Theatre marketing manager Fahiem Stellenboom said: "This is such an honour and we are thrilled to present this lineup of productions at the largest and most prestigious arts festival in the world, while the Baxter celebrates its 40th birthday and especially given our history as a theatre in SA since 1977".
