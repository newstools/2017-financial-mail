With more than 35 years of dealing with rare books, Cape Town-based bookseller Paul Mills is the brains behind AntiquarianAuctions.com, an online auction site dedicated to the sale of rare and out-of print books, maps, prints, documents, letters, ephemera and vintage photography. The website is not an Internet start-up, but has a proven track record of successfully running rare Internet book auctions. The database has been built up since 2010. AntiquarianAuctions.com is the only online auction platform for rare book dealers worldwide to auction stock. All pricing is done in US dollars and no buyer’s premium is charged. Mills is a member of rare book trade associations such as the Antiquarian Booksellers Association, the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers and the Southern African Book Dealers Association, as well as collectors’ clubs. The next online auction will be run in the period August 24-31. Among the items are a rare jigsaw puzzle of Nelson Mandela against a background of the ANC flag. It was made by War on Want, the international organisation committed to global justice, around the 1980s. It is estimated that it will attract bids of about US$400-$500. If you want something with a more international tone, then look out for The Life of Napoleon, a Hudibrastic poem in 15 cantos, by Doctor Syntax. This 260-page copy is embellished with 30 engravings by George Cruikshank. It comes in a mauve cloth solander case and it is estimated it will be sold for $1,750-$2,000.
