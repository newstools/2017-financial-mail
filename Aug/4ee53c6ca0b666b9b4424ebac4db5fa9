Got a few hours to kill between meetings or sneaking to the Fairest Cape for a weekend getaway? Here are a couple of picks to jazz up your itinerary: STAY The Silo Hotel at the V&A Waterfront is part of the brilliantly converted grain silo structure that’s been reimagined by "starchitect" Thomas Heatherwick. Later in the year, the keenly awaited Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa will open its doors in the building. For now though, one can stay in the rather plush hotel and make the most of its creature comforts and the view of the city and Table Mountain. Head for the Willaston Bar, nab a bottle of Cinsault, settle into a deep-buttoned velvet couch near the 5.5m windows and get cosy. EAT Make like the city’s trendy crowd and do the Hokey Poke! For those out of the loop, poke (pronounced poké) is a traditional Hawaiian meal of marinated raw fish, rice and a mixed bag of veggies. Poke bowls are all the rage with hipsters and health nuts alike, because they are, well, delicious. The neon-lit Hokey Poke restaurant does various takes on these bowls of deliciousness, but we rate the No 2 — salmon, avo, sweet onions, coriander, tobiko fish roe, almonds and samphire (an edible sea grass). PLAY Take a breather on an extremely comfy lounger at the Iziko Planetarium. This City Bowl gem recently underwent a R28m upgrade, and now boasts an impressive digital dome. There are two different shows aimed at adults, and a ticket will set you back R60. Why not got to infinity and beyond, and do both?
