Gender activist and award-winning author Pumla Dineo Gqola is set to release her eagerly awaited collection of autobiographical essays on power, pleasure and SA culture. Reflecting Rogue — Inside the Mind of a Feminist, which hits shelves in Women’s Month, contains 14 essays that are accessible without sacrificing intellectual rigour. Gqola, a professor of African literature at Wits University, has written extensively for both local and international academic journals. She has authored What is Slavery to Me?, A Renegade Called Simphiwe and Rape: An SA Nightmare. Reflecting Rogue is said to be her most personal book to date. Among the essays are "On the Beauty of Feminist Rage", which looks at the gender discourse in SA’s public spheres, and "My Mother’s Daughter, My Sons’ Mother", in which Gqola explores the themes of fear, envy and resentment in mother-daughter relationships, while sharing her thoughts on how to raise boys as a feminist.
