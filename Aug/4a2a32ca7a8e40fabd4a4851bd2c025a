While two of the world’s leading fund managers have differing investment philosophies and not a single stock in common, they agree on looking outside the US for investment opportunities. The fund managers, Sunil Thakor, managing director of Sands Capital Asset Management, and Dave Iben, chief investment officer at Kopernik Global Investors, were participating in a panel discussion at the recent Investec Wealth Forum, hosted by Investec Wealth & Investment. Sands and Kopernik are two of the fund managers selected by Investec to manage portfolios for Investec’s World Axis suite of portfolios. Managers are subject to a rigorous selection and due-diligence process before being selected. The panel discussion was moderated by Ryan Friedman, head of multi-manager investments at Investec Wealth & Investment SA. Thakor is a true growth investor who scours the world for opportunities in the most unlikely of places, while Iben, as a true value investor, doesn’t believe in overpaying for any stocks.
