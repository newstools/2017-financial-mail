Tradehold, the property-biased investment company controlled by retail tycoon Christo Wiese, could look at separately listing its Namibian real estate operations. Speaking at an investment presentation this week Tradehold joint CEO Friedrich Esterhuyse confirmed that the Namibian operations are already in discussions with partners to list on the Namibian Stock Exchange. "These investments are doing really well." Tradehold’s Namibian property business owns assets worth more than R700m and generated revenue of almost R60m in the year to end-February. A major development under way is the Dunes Mall, a new retail mall of about 27,000m² in Walvis Bay. This is being developed in partnership with Atterbury at a budgeted cost of N$484m and is set to open in October. Tradehold’s recently released annual report notes a shopping centre of equal size in Rundu (in the north of the country) was trading well after opening in the previous year. Esterhuyse said the Steps development in Windhoek is also progressing well, with the first phase, including a Virgin Active gym and an office block, completed at the end of 2016. He said a City Lodge is due for completion in September. Esterhuyse said Tradehold has several other projects under construction in Windhoek in conjunction with Safland, its Namibian development partner.
