Online shopping ventures have certainly taken off in SA in recent years, so choosing from the myriad options can be daunting. One worth noting is Wilberrys SA, especially if you are looking for luxury watches, clothing and accessories at affordable prices. Once ordered, your purchases are delivered by courier within 48 hours nationwide and the customer sales team is available on LiveChat to provide assistance from Monday to Sunday. Wilberrys SA was started by MBA graduate Ahmed Bawa, who was behind VIP Club, which he designed and launched from home. To stand out in a crowded market, Bawa has ensured that almost everything on offer is an exclusive brand that can be found only on the website. But the focus is on exquisite timepiece and jewellery brands such as Lamborghini, Thomas Earnshaw and St√ºhrling Original. At the Wilberrys auction, you can bid on luxury goods from R1, with the item going to the highest bidder. Lamborghini watches worth up to R28,000 have gone for 50% off on auction. Wilberrys SA is a membership website, which entitles you to discounts off watches and other luxury goods. A standard membership costs R299 for 40% off and three months, but there are different packages for different budgets. It does not include auction bids. The website will be launching a range of new collections in the next month.
