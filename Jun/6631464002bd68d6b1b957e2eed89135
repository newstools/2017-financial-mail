Gauteng theatre lovers who are unable to make the 969km trip to the National Arts Festival (NAF) in Grahamstown at the end of this month need not fret. The 969 Festival plans to bring the best of the NAF to Johannesburg from July 14 to July 30. Among the 28 shows on stage at the Wits Theatre in Braamfontein will be Standard Bank Young Artist Award winner for dance Thandazile Radebe’s Sabela, playwright Mike van Graan’s new play Helen of Troyeville, Naledi award winners Jade Bowers and Ameera Patel’s new show Black, Tshego Khutsoane’s production of Yellowman and Jovan Muthray and Mlindeli Zondi’s The Crucifixion of Amagqwirha. There is also much to laugh about, with Mortimer Williams’s stand-up comedy-cum-cabaret The Full Morty, Kristy Suttner’s Six Inches and Toni Morkel’s KidCasino. And because the 969 Festival falls in the school holidays this year, there will be a number of theatre productions aimed at children, mostly scheduled for the weekend of July 15-16. Look out for Space Rocks, a new play about early childhood development and emotional growth that combines science, technology and mythology; Jitterbugs, a musical-comedy-sketch written by primary school kids and performed by professionals; and Rat Race, an eco-themed play which is styled like a pop-up storybook. On the music programme are concerts by Steven Newman (guitar) and Ashish Joshi (tabla), Samthing Soweto and the duo Dikelo & Bongile. And in a rousing encore, 100 voices of the Hoërskool Randburg Choir will sing songs from around the world in their show Let There Be Music.
