FNB continues to make the most of a great app, adding new features and services that are actually useful and take its offering beyond banking. Its latest is navCar, which helps you navigate car-related services in the same way the navHome tool helps you make your way around home-ownership admin such as valuations and finding service providers. You can add a car by scanning the licence disc or manually adding in details. From there, you can renew your car licence, see fines registered against your number plate, access “on-road protect” (an insurance-type product), or access your car payment history, if applicable. If your car financing is through WesBank, your details will automatically be loaded onto the app when you add your car. The most useful are the first two. You pay an additional R199 to have your car registration renewed and delivered to you. It may seem a tad steep just to avoid a trip to the post office, but in time saved (and for the convenience factor) this seems like real value to me. You can also enable reminder alerts ahead of your licence renewal date. You can renew on behalf of dependants and send the new licence directly to them. You can see and pay fines for “minor traffic infringements” directly in the app. The “on-road protect” option costs R95/month. It offers a bundled price for up to five disc renewals, tyre repair claim assistance for pothole damage and 24/7 bail assistance at roadblocks (if that is something you anticipate needing).
