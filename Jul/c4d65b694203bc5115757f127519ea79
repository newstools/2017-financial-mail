In a house decorated with horror movie posters, a young woman’s body is found on her bed, with two bloodied objects clutched in her palm. Detective Jane Rizzoli and forensic pathologist Maura Isles are called to the murder scene, but are unable to identify the immediate cause of death. Sound familiar? No, it’s not a scene from popular television series Rizzoli & Isles, but it is the plot of American author Tess Gerritsen’s latest book, I Know a Secret. Gerritsen’s books are the inspiration for the series, and I Know a Secret will almost certainly be the basis of a future episode. Gerritsen, a retired physician, brings her experience of emergency and autopsy rooms to her writing. She also studied anthropology at Stanford University, and those already familiar with her writing may be able to place her fascination with centuries-old human remains. I Know a Secret will be on SA shelves early next month.
