Join Tiso Blackstar editor in chief Peter Bruce and his guests for an in-depth discussion and debate of the stories that are driving SA’s news agenda. This week the hard-hitting discussion centres on whether deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa can be trusted as he gains more support. They also talk about what else Eskom is hiding as it postpones its results, the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s about-turn on the Reserve Bank and South Africa’s first family, the Guptas. Bruce is joined by Business Day editor Tim Cohen; Financial Mail deputy editor Sikonathi Mantshantsha and BusinessLIVE editor Ray Hartley. Editing Allowed airs on Business Day TV on DStv channel 412.
