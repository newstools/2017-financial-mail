This exquisite home is located on a 8,228mÂ² residential plot in Upper Constantia with beautiful mountain views. The contemporary Cape Dutch house offers six bedrooms, six bathrooms, extensive living and entertainment areas, a cinema and media room, floodlit tennis courts and a wine cellar. A separate thatched building houses a gym area, showers and change rooms, and a steam room. Reminiscent of a grand French chateau, this home, with its high ceilings and large proportions, oozes panache. The house boasts five en-suite bedrooms and large reception areas that flow onto a wrap-around entertainment patio, as well as a wine room, gym, separate cottage, two staff suites and a guardhouse.
