Johannesburg has a fresh new entertainment and chill venue in the city centre. Joziburg, at 1 Eloff Street, will host films, exhibitions, rooftop parties and food venues in an eye-catching blue and turquoise block. The complex, already home to some residential and office space, opens at the end of this month with an array of events. On Thursday July 27 the Kulture Kollective will launch The Kollective Pop Up, a gallery at Joziburg. The collective will partner with other creatives from fashion, sneaker culture, art and design, starting with The Uncultured Club. Every last Thursday of the month, over the next five months, the gallery will introduce a new collaboration around a night-market setting, where there will be drinks, cocktails and food to match the environment. On Friday July 28 there will be workshops and talks from 4pm to 7pm at the Kollective gallery. The first conversation will be with Anthony Bila, Nicholas Rawhani and Chisanga Mubanga of The Uncultured Club. The Feel Good Series — a monthly day party that will take place every last Saturday of the month at Joziburg’s rooftop venue — kicks off on Saturday July 29. It’s a laid-back event that stretches into the evening and will feature appearances by popular artists and DJs.
