The magic touch of Tesla founder and CE Elon Musk in attracting the best brains and investors has resulted in shares in the electric car maker rising 7% to US$49bn, overtaking iconic old-era Ford ($46bn) in market value. The jump came after Tesla announced it had delivered over 25,000 cars in the first quarter a 70% year-on-year increase. It s still only a fraction of Ford s output 6.7m vehicles last year but investors clearly see growth potential in Tesla, which some believe has replaced BMW as an aspirational car.President Jacob Zuma s cabinet reshuffle essentially the irrational axing of finance minister Pravin Gordhan provoked the first of what s likely to be a series of rating agency downgrades of the sovereign. The rand fell 10% in the week, bond yields spiked, business and investor confidence eroded further, and SA s economic growth outlook hit rock bottom. But there was not a flicker of doubt in Zuma s cold eyes, even as calls for his removal grew and his destruction of the ANC and Mandela s legacy caused national anxiety.
