Bright lights and an iconic skyline is why two of the four choices are in Johannesburg. The San Deck at the Sandton Sun is a great outdoor venue with a scintillating view. With three large fire pits, lounge seating, live music, and a DJ on weekends, it’s a popular choice for informal get-togethers and social occasions. Open till late, it serves light meals throughout the day including salads, seasonal soups, hearty sandwiches, hot dogs and gourmet bunny chows. The Island Bar at the Southern Sun Hyde Park allows you to unwind with a cocktail while taking in the Highveld sunset. From light lunchtime snacks to indulgent sundowners, it is one of Johannesburg’s most stylish venues. At Durban’s Panorama Bar & Pool Deck at the Elangeni & Maharani you can, well, drink in the view. You can make a day of it — it overlooks Durban’s golden beachfront and serves a range of drinks and light meals throughout the day. Heading to the west coast what’s better than sipping a glass of pinot noir while you take in Cape Town’s bustling harbour? Doing so in the beautifully decorated new Life Grand Café at the Waterfront is the answer. Not a rooftop bar, but much like its inland siblings, this new seaside spot, offers the glamorous interiors and good food combo synonymous with owner/interior designer Maira Koutsoudakis and her team. The restaurant is housed in a heritage building that dates back to 1902 that the team have lovingly restored. If you’re eating there, we recommend the burger.
