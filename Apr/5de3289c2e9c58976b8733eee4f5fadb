The axing of finance minister Pravin Gordhan, followed by SA s swift downgrade to junk status by ratings agencies S&amp;P and Fitch, have many running scared, wondering whether President Jacob Zuma has set the country on an irrevocable path towards a debt crisis.South Africans who lived through the debt standstill triggered by PW Botha s failure to cross the Rubicon in 1985 can see the similarities in the way the economy is being held hostage to the mad power play of an obdurate president.But other than that there are no similarities between then and now, say former SA Reserve Bank and national treasury officials who played a key role in events in 1985.In fact, government never defaulted on its debt and it was not the bond market that disciplined the president. Rather, the debt crisis was caused by international banks, starting with Chase Manhattan in July 1985, pulling the plug on private SA companies trade facilities.Government couldn t borrow on international markets because of sanctions and it had, in any event, made very little use of foreign borrowing.This had created foreign exchange reserve shortages at the Reserve Bank, which meant it was unable to provide sufficient dollars for private companies to service their foreign loans. Hence the decision by foreign banks to freeze these credit lines.The private companies prepaid the outstanding debt, the rand equivalent of $13.6bn, into an account held at the Public Investment Corp. A standstill committee under the chairmanship of Chris Stals, then governor of the Reserve Bank, negotiated a repayment plan with a club of international banks."The country had to reschedule the dollar repayments of these debts so the pressure on the country s reserves could be managed," explains Estian Calitz, a former treasury director-general.The Reserve Bank never missed a payment, every loan was repaid and there was no reduction in the capital amount, but it took until 2001 to clear the debt.Because SA didn t repay the capital on time, the episode satisfied the International Monetary Fund s definition of a technical default, though a debt standstill would be a more accurate description of what actually happened.Today, SA has almost $40bn (R560bn) worth of foreign exchange reserves equivalent to a comfortable six months of import cover. The average maturity on international government bonds is a healthy 10.5 years, and only about 10% of SA s debt is repayable in hard currency.As such, the currency composition and term structure of SA s debt remain highly favourable. The country s well-developed domestic financial markets also reduce its financing risk relative to that of its peers.SA s debt profile has slipped compared with its peers, as it has accumulated debt faster since 2009. But with net government debt still below 50% of GDP, SA s position remains broadly comparable. Moreover, government s pension fund is fully funded, which is unusual among emerging markets.Quite simply, SA has conducted an astute financial policy over the past 20 years, so there is little possibility, given the amount of debt it has to roll over, that it could face a serious fiscal crisis in the near term."Things aren t nearly as bad as some seem to fear," says John Ashbourne of London-based Capital Economics. "The country s fiscal deficit is only about 3.5% of GDP, while general government debt is only 53% of GDP. Neither of these figures is particularly notable by emerging-market standards. There are, as yet, no signs that SA is likely to see a repeat of Brazil s debt problems."And though the rand has lost more than 12% since Zuma s cabinet reshuffle to trade at just under R14/$, the rand recovery of the past few months means it is actually stronger than its average level of R14/$ for the past year. This means the impact of the recent rout on inflation and the real economy will be limited."In short, SA s balance sheet is in reasonable shape," says Ashbourne. "There is little risk of a sudden crisis over the short term."The problem is that there is a high risk of looser fiscal policy following Malusi Gigaba s appointment as finance minister. This, and the "negative" rating outlooks held by S&amp;P and Moody s, make it likely that the rand has a lot further to fall.Late last week, Fitch cut both SA s foreign and local currency ratings to junk. Earlier, S&amp;P had cut SA s foreign currency debt to junk while keeping domestic debt at investment grade, albeit with a negative outlook. Should S&amp;P and Moody s also downgrade SA s local currency rating to junk, SA would be dropped from the World Government Bond Index, which could trigger $8bn-$13bn of forced selling by foreign investors, according to various estimates.The capital outflow would force the rand to fresh lows, inviting higher interest rates and wiping out SA s fragile growth recovery, if it hasn t been already.Gigaba s conduct as minister is key to whether SA suffers further multiple downgrades. Even if he is able to honour his pledge of sticking to treasury s expenditure ceiling and consolidation path, gross national debt won t stabilise at 53% of GDP unless growth recovers.To achieve SA s fiscal targets, Gigaba will have to halt the governance and financial deterioration of struggling state-owned enterprises a task that seemed beyond even Gordhan. And this was before Eskom was set to proceed with the nuclear build.In fact, SA s long-term fiscal trajectory wasn t going to be sustainable under Gordhan without further adjustments.Reacting to S&amp;P s downgrade, treasury misrepresented its own long-term fiscal studies. In its press release it said SA should take comfort from the fact that its long-term model shows existing core social spending priorities (including education, health and social grants) are sustainable over the coming decades.What the model actually showed when it was released in 2014 was that SA s current level of social spending would be sustainable only if real economic growth returned to its historic average of 3%-3.5% annually. Since then growth has slowed to almost zero.The Reuters consensus estimate, made before the cabinet reshuffle and subsequent downgrades, is that growth will not hit 2% before 2019.No credible economist believes a return to 3% growth is possible under the current administration, especially as the Reserve Bank puts SA s current maximum growth potential at just 1.3%.To grow at double this figure would require wholesale leadership renewal in government and the ruling ANC. It would also require a complete change of view on the economy, from one that wants an ever-greater interventionist role for the state to one that acknowledges that the state has neither the funds nor the capacity to carry on playing this role.In 2015, Prof Stan du Plessis of Stellenbosch University modelled what would most likely happen to SA s debt and interest costs over the long term under generous assumptions, including long-run growth of 2%, no downgrades and low interest rates.Out of 100 simulations, the most likely (median) fiscal scenario was unsustainable over a 10-year horizon.Specifically, he found that by 2025, SA s interest bill would once again be back up at 5% of GDP (the 1994 level) and the debt ratio would be close to 65% of GDP all previous fiscal progress having been wiped out.In short, before Gordhan was axed and SA lost its investment-grade rating, the country was only 10 years away from tumbling over the fiscal cliff that fundamental moment when the bond market would become persuaded that SA could no longer service its debt."With the downgrades, a finance minister who is untested in that department (but with a poor track record on economy-related matters) and who is sympathetic to heterodox ideas in economics, the probability that fiscal policy is on an unsustainable medium-run track is just higher," says Du Plessis. "Of course, with R1trillion nuclear [spending] on top of the projected fiscal evolution, there are no sustainable fiscal paths that I can see."Institute of Race Relations CEO Frans Cronje believes that while Zuma has checkmated everyone, and that "as a free and open society SA may already have passed the point of no return", the Zuma faction has no desire to destroy the economy."I do think the Zuma faction is sincere in wishing to restore growth and job creation and maintain fiscal stability," says Cronje, explaining that growth of about 1% will be needed to support its policy of "sustainable wealth extraction".He expects the economy to lapse into an uneasy stasis under a victorious Zuma faction rather than a catastrophic recession, assuming the global economy plays ball and society fails to unify into an effective opposing force."We re in the basement, but we have more time than we think," says Cronje.Of course, growth will dribble away under this scenario because of draconian tax hikes and collapsing competitiveness, but not for a while yet. And if Cronje is right that South Africans will grudgingly absorb this fate as the new normal, the country could fold in the end with "more of a whimper than a bang".
