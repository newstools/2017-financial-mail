Had Malusi Gigaba been appointed finance minister today, rather than three weeks ago, it seems unlikely he d have hired Wits University economics professor Chris Malikane as one of his advisers.Gigaba seems to have undergone a Damascene moment following the downgrade to junk status. Whereas, initially after his appointment, Gigaba spoke boldly of "radical economic transformation", now his language is of "inclusive growth".But Malikane won t be swayed.In an article in the Sunday Times, he argued for nationalising SA s banks and mines, argued that quality social services must be free, suggested empowerment schemes are largely a "bribes system", and said only white monopoly capital and the "credit-based black bourgeoisie" objected to Pravin Gordhan s axing.Malikane s "solutions" are a hodgepodge of old Marxist ideology and, tellingly, he doesn t say how his alternative economy would work practically or how it would be financed.It s little wonder that on Tuesday Gigaba s office rushed to say Malikane s views did not represent government policy, that Gigaba "will continue to be guided by the policies of the ANC", and that "nationalisation of banks is not government policy".It was a blunt slap for a government adviser. Mercifully, it seems Malikane s 15 minutes of fame may already be up.
