Mamphela Ramphele had a brief foray into SA politics and its ending was messy. Her latest book, Dreams, Betrayal and Hope, is a candid revisit of that time, in which she also offers some solutions to the countryâ€™s problems. Ramphele believes that the dream of 1994, which offered equality, a thriving economy, and a just and prosperous future for all, has been betrayed. Poverty has deepened, corruption is rampant, and social tensions are on the rise. She argues that the political settlement of the 1990s needs to be accompanied by an "emotional settlement" that will heal the trauma of colonialism and apartheid.
