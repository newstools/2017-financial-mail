Though the experiment ended this year, its results have led some to suggest that in the long-term, a shorter working day actually saves money. The nurses were less tired, took fewer sick days, had lower average blood pressure and provided a better quality service to the patients in their care. What s not to like?2. Pimp your tombstoneWhen Joe Mafela s 6t living room tombstone was unveiled in March, his family who said they wanted to reflect how he entertained South Africans throughout his life may not have heard about a Slovenian innovation.
