In 1974 and 1975 Nintendo produced its first console and began creating games for homes and arcades. It was Donkey Kong in 1981 that catapulted it to international success. And when a dumpy, mustachioed Italian plumber named Mario was introduced to the world, a fandom was born.Mario s exploits are still wildly popular 36 years later.
