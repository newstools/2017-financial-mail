Conduit Capital, the investment company underpinned by niche insurance operations, has topped a period of typical hustle and bustle by spearheading a bid to buy out specialist financial services business Finbond.Earlier this month Conduit along with related party Protea Asset Management pushed up its stake in Finbond to 36.8%, triggering a mandatory offer to all shareholders. A subsequent Sens notice from Conduit confirmed that it, along with the US-based Riskowitz Value Fund (RVF) and Ithuba Investments, would pitch an offer to Finbond minorities. RVF and Ithuba are investment entities associated with Sean Riskowitz, the CEO of Conduit Capital.No price has yet been set for the offer to minorities. But the offer price will be linked to the average price at which the Conduit consortium acquired the tranches of shares that triggered the mandatory offer.It seems doubtful that the Conduit consortium will secure 100% of Finbond, which has a market capitalisation of R2.4bn, with other larger shareholders most likely not wanting to sell.Kings Reign Investments (associated with Finbond CEO Willie van Aardt) and technology group Net1 UEPS hold 33.7% and 25.9% of Finbond respectively.Sources suggested that if Conduit s offer were taken up by enough "other" minorities there could be a temptation to delist the company from the JSE.Finbond recently disclosed that headline earnings for the year to end-February would rocket to between 17.43c/share and 19.36c/share. The company said the increases ranging from 66% to 84% were driven by a successful expansion into the North American market.Last year Finbond acquired several payday lending and short-term loan businesses in the US and Canada, securing a sprawling financial services niche that now accounts for the bulk of the company s earnings.Indications are that taking Finbond private might facilitate future capital raising efforts to grow the North American business with larger shareholders who are not fazed about pitching more cash into the fast-growing company.Finbond raised R525m in a rights issue during March last year, but there are whispers of further deal-making, with Finbond trading under cautionary since February.Finbond is not the only tilt that Conduit has taken in recent weeks. The company once again in conjunction with Protea has also pushed its stake in low-cost housing developer Calgro M3 to 34.4%, which is just below the shareholding level that would trigger an offer to minorities.Conduit s other major listed investments include fast-food franchisor Taste Holdings, vehicle retailer Combined Motor Holdings, Namibian investment company Trustco and industrial services conglomerate ENX Group.Conduit also had a change in beneficial ownership this month when large US-based shareholder Buckley Capital reduced its stake from 14.9% to 5.93%.Investment company Snowball Wealth and associated entities, via founder Leo Chou, appeared to pick up Buckley s shares, increasing their stake to 19.4%.
