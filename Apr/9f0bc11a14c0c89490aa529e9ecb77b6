Longform is a podcast about the craft of writing. It&#8217;s funny and interesting and not just for scribes &#8212; in case you were wondering. If you&#8217;re a reader you&#8217;ll be just as intrigued at the process of reporting. Importantly, the podcast goes beyond method (how do you take notes?) and allows listeners a glimpse of behind the scenes &quot;stuff&quot; and the quirk that doesn&#8217;t make it into print. If you liked HBO&#8217;s The Newsroom, you&#8217;ll like this.Each episode (and there are already over 200) of the podcast features an author or editor of a news story. I like the ones with Jon Favreau, Obama&#8217;s speechwriter (#196), and Eat, Pray, Love author Elizabeth Gilbert (#187).You can subscribe to Longform on iTunes.
