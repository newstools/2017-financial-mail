There were many predications about what a Donald Trump presidency might spawn — but very few expected it to be the spark for a global movement against misogyny, bigotry and sexism. Or that the symbol of the new resistance would be a knitted pink “pussy hat”, a comment on Trump’s shocking boast — on leaked video from 2005 — that he grabbed women by the genitals when he felt the urge. Or that the first controversy of the Trump presidency would be over the size of the crowds at his inauguration and those at the women’s marches. Confronted with aerial photographic evidence that his crowd was far smaller than that which inaugurated Barack Obama, Trump’s entourage introduced a new phrase to the political lexicon: “alternative facts”. They simply denounced the media for publishing propaganda and said that their “alternative facts” showed that Trump had the bigger audience. Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, told Fox News: “The point is not the crowd size. The point is the attacks and the attempt to delegitimise this president in one day. And we’re not going to sit around and take it.” Trump himself presented some “alternative facts” about the crowd, saying: “I made a speech, I looked out, the field was, it looked like a million, million and a half people. They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there.” Bruce Springsteen was in Australia, when crowds totalling well over 1m marched against Trump the day after his inauguration. The Boss told reporters that he supported the “new resistance” against Trump. This from a Reuters report: “Our hearts and our spirits are with all the millions of people who marched yesterday.” The image of choice for the new resistance was a portrait of a Muslim woman draped in a US flag. It looks like the world will have to endure at least four years of warfare between the new resistance and Trump’s alternative facts.
