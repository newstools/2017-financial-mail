Africa’s relief at Gambian dictator Yahya Jammeh finally quitting owes much to the quiet political and diplomatic skill of Senegal’s president, Macky Sall, whose country envelopes Gambia and therefore had the most to lose had things unravelled. Sall was pivotal in Ecowas’s mediation and threat to send in soldiers to remove Jammeh, who’d refused to accept the election of Adama Barrow as president. Jammeh flew out this week, to Equatorial Guinea, stripping the treasury of US$11m on his way. Cheap at the price. Inauguration to the highest office in the land and indeed the world did little to still the temper of new US president Donald Trump. There he was on his first full day at work, not “reaching out” but fulminating against the media for observing fewer people were at his swearing-in than at Barack Obama’s, and for having reported on his invective against the US intelligence agencies. At the CIA he veered off topic to talk about his mental age. Perhaps it was the women’s protest marches, or bookies’ odds that he’ll be impeached or resign.
