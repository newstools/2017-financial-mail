We analyse Rhandzo Mukansi, interest rate market analyst at Futuregrowth. If someone came to you tomorrow with R100m to invest in just one company, which would it be? Of That Nature, a socially responsible, e-commerce based start-up organics business. Which talent would you most like to have? I’m a prolific footballer — in my head. I would wish it to life if I could. What’s your biggest regret? As far as investing goes, it’s not having converted my paper portfolios to rands and cents sooner. It’s a marvel how quickly you learn when your own money is on the line. What’s the best investment you’ve ever made? Undoubtedly the cows I paid towards my wife’s lobola. No market yield could rival my returns. Name a place you’ve been to that lived up to the hype? London, surprisingly. The blend of old-school charm and new-age edginess is captivating. What’s your favourite song? Sade — By Your Side. What’s your worst investment mistake? Succumbing to fear and greed (and their blinding effect on sound judgment) in my earlier days as a young analyst. If you could fix one thing in SA today, what would it be? I would fix our education system, particularly pertaining to its quality and accessibility. The bulk of SA’s ills can be blamed on our struggling education system. What was your first job? I coached soccer and rugby at my childhood primary school. My first paying job was as a sports coach at university.
