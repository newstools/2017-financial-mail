We analyse Ahmed Motara, analyst/portfolio manager, Stanlib. If someone came to you tomorrow with R100m to invest in just one company, which would it be? It would be MAS Plc. Companies that offer diversified global property and hard currency exposure across markets and are in strong enough positions to quantitatively give dividend guidance for multiple years are hard to ignore. Plus, what I love about property companies is that not only do you often get strong capital growth in the long term, but you also get dividends that you can enjoy in the short term. Which talent would you most like to have? To be able to get my knee down on the ground, like Valentino Rossi when riding a superbike. On what occasion do you lie? I go with the ethos that if you don’t have anything good to say, don’t say anything at all. What’s the best investment you’ve ever made? My family. They give purpose to my life and there are few greater pleasures in life than spending money on loved ones. Name a place you’ve been to that lived up to the hype? Berlin. What’s your favourite song? Bob Dylan’s "The Times They Are A-Changin’." What’s your worst investment mistake? Listening to other investment analysts and relying on their views and good reputations early in my career, rather than doing the hard work of understanding a company properly myself. If you could fix one thing in SA today, what would it be? The education system. What was your first job? I worked as an equity trader at Deutsche Securities. It was a baptism of fire with a steep learning curve, for which I am very grateful. What is your greatest extravagance? My motorcycle, I’ve always wanted to learn to ride one.
