Preference shares are listed on the JSE in the same way general equity shares are. They are issued by companies as an alternative way to raise capital. The shares are similar to debt instruments, as they pay investors a fixed return in the form of a dividend. Though preference shareholders are not guaranteed to receive dividends, they have a preferential right to be paid before ordinary shareholders — as long as the company has made a profit. The downside is that preference shareholders don’t share in the growth of the company. Instead, preference shares are linked to the prime interest rate, with yields moving up or down accordingly. There are mainly two types of preference shares: Cumulative shares, for which the dividend will carry forward to successive years if the company doesn’t earn sufficient profit to pay it; and Noncumulative shares, for which unpaid dividends in one year don’t carry over.
