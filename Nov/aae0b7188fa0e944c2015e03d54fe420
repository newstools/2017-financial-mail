We question Stefan Rabe, CEO of Bounty Brands (Superdry, Vans, Levi’s Footwear).  Which historical figure do you most identify with? Walt Disney, for his ability to translate passion into enduring success. What book are you reading at the moment? I am a prolific reader, so I read pretty much everything I can get my hands on. A must-read for me is anything by Carl Hiaasen — guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. Which phrase or word do you most overuse? Crawl, walk, run! What was your first job? I designed concrete beams and columns manually for months on end — a job that’s now done by computers in seconds. What is your biggest regret? Spending too much time in "Big Corporate" before striking out on my own. What’s the most interesting thing about you that people don’t know?

Very few days pass without me having a piece or two. What is the one investment you wish you had made earlier? Property — I paid someone else’s bond for too long.
