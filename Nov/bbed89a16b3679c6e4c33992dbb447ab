Combining two devices, the Lenovo Miix 720 offers the convenience and portability of a tablet with the performance and capability of a serious laptop. It’s a "convertible", or two-in-one computing solution, that can be paired with a keyboard or operated as a full-touch tablet as needed. The Miix 720 price tag is definitely at the high end of the market — with a recommended retail price of R27,499. What does an investment of that size get you? The 12-inch screen is full-touch and offers a QHD resolution of 2880 x 1920 pixels (in line with devices like the new MacBook Pros), luminosity of 400nits, covered in durable Gorilla Glass. It’s a great screen, with brilliant colour and saturation. The keyboard is full-size and backlit, attaching quickly and simply to the device with a magnetic connection. On the back of the screen is a kickstand for positioning, connected with stainless-steel watchband hinges. Even with the keyboard in place the package weighs just over 1kg, so portability is not going to be a problem here. The device runs Windows 10 and packs a decidedly snappy Core i7 processor for shrugging off multiple tasks without lag. Lenovo promises battery of "up to eight hours", but I would keep the charger handy for a full day’s work, especially if you’re going to be testing that multitasking ability. It has Bluetooth, as well as one Type C USB (3.1) connection, and two regular USB (3.0 and 2.0) connections, a slot for a microSD card and an audio jack. It comes with a Lenovo Active Pen 2, a stylus, for improved accuracy on the touch screen. There are many of these convertible devices available at the moment. The trend for combining tablets and laptops began a couple of years ago.
