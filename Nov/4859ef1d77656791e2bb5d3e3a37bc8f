 Known as Hathaway, this charming thatched home was built in the 1940s. The restored property offers four bedrooms, five bathrooms, a large covered terrace and a manicured, landscaped garden. Additional features include garaging for six cars, staff accommodation, a floodlit tennis court, a heated pool, solar panels, a borehole and a large guest cottage/work-from-home space.  Built in 1841, this three-bedroom home is the oldest remaining gabled house in the quaint Karoo village and features typical Cape Dutch features such as yellowwood floors, ceilings and muurkassies (built-in cabinets). The property was restored and renovated in 1996 under the guidance of Stellenbosch architect Raymond Bouma. The house sits on just over 1ha of prime farmland in the centre of town.
