  For the first time, South Africans will be able to buy property on the island of Zanzibar, with the launch this week of developer Pennyroyal’s luxury lifestyle and golf resort Blue Amber. The first phase of 47 double-storey villas, all with ocean, lake or golf-course views, will be available to non-Tanzanian residents through a 99-year lease agreement, with the option to extend by 49 years.   This spacious north-facing family home overlooks a green at Steenberg Golf Club in leafy Constantiaberg, in Cape Town’s southern suburbs. It offers bright and airy open-plan living, with three generous bedrooms, two bathrooms, a formal lounge, a sun room and a study. Steenberg has become popular among well-heeled buyers for its top-rate lifestyle and security offerings.
