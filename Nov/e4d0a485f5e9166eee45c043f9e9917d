The ANC in the Western Cape has wisely chosen Cyril Ramaphosa as its candidate for the party presidency. Ironically, in the bigger picture, even supporters of the DA, which “owns” the region, should welcome his candidature in the hope he will lead the country out of the mess left by Jacob Zuma. At the same time, the DA must up the ante if it wishes to retain the Western Cape because, in the event of Ramaphosa becoming president, there could be a swing away from the incumbent. So, no more Patricia de Lille-type incidents reflecting a divided party. This is an ideal time for serious introspection and statesmanlike leadership from the main opposition in preparation for the 2019 election. Ramaphosa at the helm could change the whole political landscape — including by wresting the Western Cape from the DA. There’s no time to be playing silly buggers in the opposition ranks.
