It may be one of the smallest provinces by ANC membership, but the party in the Western Cape overwhelmingly backed Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed Jacob Zuma as president. The deputy president was endorsed by 121 of its 145 branches (though they don’t favour his running mate Naledi Pandor), while his main rival Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma got just 13. Also in Cyril’s bag is the Northern Cape. Could it signal gathering momentum for his campaign to peak just in time for the elective congress starting on December 16?  Gauteng’s suspended director of mental health, Makgabo Manamela had a torrid time as she skirted issues and dodged taking responsibility for the Life Esidimeni tragedy that resulted in the deaths of more than 140 psychiatric patients due to decisions made by the Gauteng government. Even the usually composed former deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke, who presides over the arbitration, lost his cool, telling her she just didn’t "get it" as they tried to make her realise the fatal consequences of her actions.
