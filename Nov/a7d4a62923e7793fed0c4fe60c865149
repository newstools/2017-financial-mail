A weekly round up of the hottest international retail and consumer news. 1. Getting its java fix In line with its strategy to buy niche brands that appeal to younger consumers, Nestlé has bought Texas-based coffee startup Chameleon. The brand, which launched in 2010, is the number one cold brew brand in the US. The maker of Nescafe and Nespresso also bought a majority stake in Blue Bottle Coffee back in September. 2. Minus the chocolate Chocolatier Hershey launched its first new bar in 22 years — and it contains no chocolate. The Hershey Gold bar is made of caramelised crème, pretzels, and peanuts. It was created after more than 18 months of development and testing and is the first new bar in the Hershey portfolio since Cookies & Cream was released in 1995. Taste testers have likened the new bar to a cross between peanut butter fudge and salted caramel. 3. Hanging the ‘for sale’ sign Mickey Drexler, chairman of fashion retailer J.Crew, revealed this week that the company approached Amazon about a possible sale. Amazon’s interest in the fashion market is growing — over the past two years it has launched its own clothing lines and bought a slew of online fashion chains, including Shopbop. J.Crew is owned by TPG, a private equity firm. 4. All the deets on Disney Walt Disney’s new subscription service will debut in the second half of 2019 and be priced "substantially below" Netflix (which goes for about $11 a month), CEO Bob Iger said this week. It will feature Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars films several months after their release in cinemas. There will also be a number of original TV shows. The new Disney service hasn’t been named yet.
